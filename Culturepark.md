#CulturePark## is an innovative framework designed to enhance cross-cultural understanding in large language models (LLMs). It employs a multi-agent communication system where LLM-based agents simulate human interactions across diverse cultural backgrounds. This approach generates high-quality dialogues that encapsulate human beliefs, norms, and customs, addressing cultural biases inherent in many LLMs.

##Key Features of CulturePark:##

###Multi-Agent Framework:## Simulates cross-cultural human communication by assigning LLM-based agents to represent different cultural roles.
###Data Generation:## Produces extensive cultural datasets, facilitating the fine-tuning of culture-specific LLMs.
###Evaluation Metrics:## Assesses models across tasks such as content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education, demonstrating performance that matches or surpasses existing models like GPT-4.
